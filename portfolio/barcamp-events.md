## Story

Annually occurring since 2009, BarCamp Omaha is an annually organized creative un-conference. BarCamps are unique events that allow anyone to show up, give a talk, and share their passion with folks in their community. In 2019, I had the opportunity to document the event in order to help tell the story of why attending BarCamps are so beneficial to communities.

> At BarCamp, we've ditched the predetermined speaker list. We're a user-generated unconference that provides a space for everyday humans to share their passions. Talks aren’t scheduled until just before the conference starts, and anyone can speak — though it's just as rewarding to sit back and listen. There's no bar (except for drinks at the opening party) and no camp (unless you bring your own tent). But there's a whole lot to discover. BarCamp is a chance to network, learn something new, and communicate what you’re most passionate about. Come one, come all!
