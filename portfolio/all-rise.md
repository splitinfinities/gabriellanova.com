## Story

We believe all means all. That we’re all in it together. That democracy is not a spectator sport. That building an engaged and informed society takes hard work – and so we do that work. Most of all, we believe that when one of us rises, we all rise. With your support, Civic Nebraska creates a more modern and robust democracy for all Nebraskans.
