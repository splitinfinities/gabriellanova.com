## The Fall of the Host

Experience this interactive 3D model of a sculpture by Puerto Rican theatre company Y No Había Luz, titled “The Fall of the Host” which represents the first governor of Puerto Rico, Luis Muñoz Marín.

This piece, part of the exhibition “El Circo de la Ausencia (Absence Circus),” speaks to the history of Puerto Rico, when its governor transitioned the island into a colony of the United States. By looking back on Puerto Rico’s past, this piece draws critical questions about Puerto Rico’s current political status, including: Who benefits from a colonial relationship? And what kind of political identity could Puerto Rico have in the future?

Listen to an exclusive interview with artist Julio Morales as he explains the concept behind the sculpture and reflects on the island post-hurricane María.
