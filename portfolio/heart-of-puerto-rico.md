## Story

In the wake of Hurricane María – the shock, the disaster, the darkness – there is dignity. Conversations about decolonization and sovereignty for Puerto Rico had already been happening long before the storms. Knowing the island was already at a vulnerable position in its colonial relationship to the United States, Puerto Ricans responded to the catastrophe with a call for change.

Communities organized to build solidarity with one another and protect themselves from the risks of disaster capitalism. In the heart of Puerto Rico, the valley of Caguas, one group transformed an abandoned building into a community center, which they named El Centro de Apoyo Mutuo, The Center for Mutual Aid.

Their mission was simple: to help feed their community and heal the trauma and shock that the hurricanes left. El Centro de Apoyo Mutuo inspired other mutual aid centers to open across the island. These hubs provide a platform for Puerto Ricans to reclaim their autonomy and define their own process of recovery, not just from the hurricanes, but from the long history of colonization. 

Their collective efforts have emphasized the need to liberate Puerto Rico.

##### Food (comida)

Modeled after revolutionary movements like those of The Young Lords and The Black Panthers’ free food program, The Center for Mutual Aid serves breakfast and lunch to the community of Caguas on weekdays. This service does not cost money, and can instead be exchanged for people's volunteer time and resources.

##### Health (salud)

Ear acupuncture is offered at the Center for Mutual Aid each week. Provided by  certified acupuncturists who volunteer at the center, the service has helped community members relieve depression, anxiety and trauma that stemmed from Hurricane Maria and its aftermath.
