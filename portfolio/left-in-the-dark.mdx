## Story

After nearly one year in darkness and more than $100 billion in storm damages from Hurricane Maria, electricity has still not returned to thousands of residents across Puerto Rico, where an estimated 5,000 people died from hurricane-related causes. And yet another disaster, a $73 billion debt, had destroyed Puerto Rico’s infrastructure long before the storms.

The vulnerability produced by two major hurricanes and a 10-year recession, amid another hurricane season, calls for action. Disaster capitalism experts caution that outsiders will try to profit off Puerto Rico’s severely damaged infrastructure. Public education and other services are becoming more privatized, with more than 200 public schools closing in the past six months.

A recent Harvard study estimates the death count from Hurricane Maria as more than 70 times the official government toll. However, the crisis has still not struck much of a response from the United States congress. Some Puerto Ricans are not surprised by this.

“The hurricane just rushed us ahead of a crisis we’ve been living since 2006,” said Jorge Diaz, founder and artistic director of the organization Agitarte. 

After the slow response of U.S. and Puerto Rican governments to aid the humanitarian crisis on the island, grassroots groups quickly organized. A sustainable and just recovery has been the emphasis of these groups, demanding a democratic process led by and for Puerto Ricans. 

While people in Puerto Rico work to rebuild and empower their communities, they also face significant challenges, a myriad of austerity measures and frequent state violence. An estimated 200,000 people out of 3.5 million residents are expected to leave the island by the end of 2018.

This project, named to reflect the ongoing power outage in Puerto Rico and the negligent disaster response from the U.S., documents life in the wake of Hurricane Maria, and shows the dignity held by people in the face of injustice.
