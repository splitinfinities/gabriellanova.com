Dominique Morgan (she/her) is an award-winning artist, activist, and TEDx speaker. She is the executive director of Black and Pink, where she works daily to dismantle the systems that perpetuate violence against LGBTQ+ and gender non-conforming people and individuals who are living with HIV/AIDS. 

Here, in honor of Juneteenth — which celebrates the formal end of slavery in the United States — Morgan writes about her experiences of incarceration, growing up as a young transgender woman, and why intersectionality and liberation of all Black people are crucial aspects of commemorating June 19.
