## Story

I have worked as a producer for SXSW since 2022. As a producer, I lead and coordinate a crew of camera ops, an audio engineer, on-camera host and P.A. 

I’ve produced more than a dozen official SXSW red carpet video interviews for SXSW Film Festival, including Sheryl Crow, Regina Hall, Tanya Tucker, Tim Heidecker, Dermont Mulroney, Kishi Bashi and many more. 

I’ve also produced official SXSW Q&A videos featuring up-and-coming directors. This includes James Morosini, director and star of ‘I Love My Dad’ which premiered at SXSW 2022 with accolades and encore screenings. The story portrays Morosini’s real-life relationship with his father, played in the film by Patton Oswald. The SXSW encore screening was the first time Morosini’s father ever saw the film.
