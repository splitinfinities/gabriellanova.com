## Story

In 2017, Joelle Wellansa Sandfort and I founded The Mez, a multidisciplinary arts studio in downtown Lincoln, Nebraska. We intended to bring together artists across generations with an all-ages, substance-free venue concept. 

The Mez hosted dozens of shows, exhibits, and concerts over the years, including exhibitions by Katherine Wiese, Michael Johnson, and many more. Part of my duties included event promotion, video and photo coverage, and filming artists interviews, such as this preview for a show by Casey Callahan.

In 2018, with college graduation approaching, Joelle and I decided to pursue other opportunities. A group of young artists took over management and The Mez continues to host artists to this day.
