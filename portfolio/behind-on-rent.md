## Story

Behind on Rent follows four characters in Lincoln, Nebraska, as they face eviction from their homes during a global pandemic. A single mother of three, a young man whoâ€™s been system-impacted, a newly widowed woman, and a man in recovery, are all determined to keep their homes. Their stories intersect at a courthouse where a group of lawyers have volunteered to represent the tenants in eviction proceedings.
